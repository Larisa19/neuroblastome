## Project: Bioinformatic analysis for the identification of associated variants to pediatric neuroblastome
This work focuses on the detection of variants associated with pediatric neuroblastoma by analyzing samples obtained by liquid biopsy. The main objective is to evaluate the feasibility of detecting these variants using a bioinformatics analysis pipeline in samples from pediatric patients.
Uncover insights that can contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and potential therapeutic targets.
